    <p>
      The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America.[1][3] In North
      America,
      the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears, while the subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak Islands of
      Alaska
      is known as the Kodiak bear. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled
      in size
      only by its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and slightly
      bigger
      on average.[4][5][6][7][8] The brown bear's range includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, the Himalayas, China,
      Canada,
      the United States, Hokkaido, Scandinavia, Finland, the Balkans, the Picos de Europa and the Carpathian region
      (especially Romania), Iran, Anatolia, and the Caucasus.[1][9] The brown bear is recognized as a national and state
      animal in several European countries.[10]
    </p>
    <p>While the brown bear's range has shrunk, and it has faced local extinctions across its wide range, it remains
      listed
      as
      a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total estimated
      population
      in 2017 of 110,000. As of 2012, this and the American black bear are the only bear species not classified as
      threatened
      by the IUCN, though the large sizes of both bears may be a disadvantage due to increased competition with
      humans.[1][3][7] Populations that were hunted to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries are the Atlas bear of
      North
      Africa and the Californian, Ungavan[11][12] and Mexican populations of the grizzly bear of North America. Many of
      the
      populations in the southern parts of Eurasia are highly endangered as well.[1][13] One of the smaller-bodied
      forms,
      the
      Himalayan brown bear, is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of its former range and threatened by
      uncontrolled
      poaching for its body parts.[14] The Marsican brown bear of central Italy is one of several currently isolated
      populations of the Eurasian brown bear and is believed to have a population of just 50 to 60 bears.[10][15]</p>

      <h2>Evolution and taxonomy</h2>
      <p>The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the bruin, from Middle English. This name originated in the fable History of
      Reynard the Fox translated by William Caxton from Middle Dutch bruun or bruyn, meaning brown (the color).[16][17] In the
      mid-19th century United States, the brown bear was termed "Old Ephraim" and sometimes as "Moccasin Joe".[18]</p>
      <p>The scientific name of the brown bear, Ursus arctos, comes from the Latin ursus, meaning "bear",[19] and from ·ºÑœÅŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ
      arktos, the Greek word for bear.[20]</p>
      <h3>Generalized names and evolution</h3>
      <p>Brown bears are thought to have evolved from Ursus etruscus in Asia.[21][22] The brown bear, per Kurten (1976), has been
      stated as "clearly derived from the Asian population of Ursus savini about 800,000 years ago; spread into Europe, to the
      New World."[23] A genetic analysis indicated that the brown bear lineage diverged from the cave bear species complex
      approximately 1.2‚Äì1.4 million years ago, but did not clarify if U. savini persisted as a paraspecies for the brown bear
      before perishing.[24] The oldest fossils positively identified as from this species occur in China from about 0.5
      million years ago. Brown bears entered Europe about 250,000 years ago and North Africa shortly after.[21][25] Brown bear
      remains from the Pleistocene period are common in the British Isles, where it is thought they might have outcompeted
      cave bears (Ursus spelaeus). The species entered Alaska 100,000 years ago, though they did not move south until 13,000
      years ago.[21] It is speculated that brown bears were unable to migrate south until the extinction of the much larger
      giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus).[26][27]</p>
      <p>Several paleontologists suggest the possibility of two separate brown bear migrations: inland brown bears, also known as
      grizzlies, are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska and the
      rest of the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka, which colonized the Alaskan
      peninsula. Brown bear fossils discovered in Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky and Labrador show that the species occurred farther
      east than indicated in historic records.[21] In North America, two types of the subspecies Ursus arctos horribilis are
      generally recognized‚Äîthe coastal brown bear and the inland grizzly bear; these two types broadly define the range of
      sizes of all brown bear subspecies.[13]</p>
      <h3>Scientific taxonomy</h3>
      <a href="#" class="see-also">Main article: Subspecies of brown bear</a>

      </figure>
      <p>There are many methods used by scientists to define bear species and subspecies, as no one method is always effective.
      Brown bear taxonomy and subspecies classification has been described as "formidable and confusing," with few authorities
      listing the same specific set of subspecies.[28] Genetic testing is now perhaps the most important way to scientifically
      define brown bear relationships and names. Generally, genetic testing uses the word clade rather than species because a
      genetic test alone cannot define a biological species. Most genetic studies report on how closely related the bears are
      (or their genetic distance). There are hundreds of obsolete brown bear subspecies, each with its own name, and this can
      become confusing; Hall (1981) lists 86 different types, and even as many as 90 have been proposed.[29][30] However,
      recent DNA analysis has identified as few as five main clades which contain all extant brown bears,[31][32] while a 2017
      phylogenetic study revealed nine clades, including one representing polar bears.[33] As of 2005, 15 extant or recently
      extinct subspecies were recognized by the general scientific community.[34][35]</p>
      <p>As well as the exact number of overall brown bear subspecies, its precise relationship to the polar bear also remains in
      debate. The polar bear is a recent offshoot of the brown bear. The point at which the polar bear diverged from the brown
      bear is unclear, with estimations based on genetics and fossils ranging from 400,000 to 70,000 years ago, but most
      recent analysis has indicated that the polar bear split somewhere between 275,000 and 150,000 years ago.[36] Under some
      definitions, the brown bear can be construed as the paraspecies for the polar bear.[37][38][39][40]</p>
      <p>DNA analysis shows that, apart from recent human-caused population fragmentation,[41] brown bears in North America are
      generally part of a single interconnected population system, with the exception of the population (or subspecies) in the
      Kodiak Archipelago, which has probably been isolated since the end of the last Ice Age.[42][43] These data demonstrate
      that U. a. gyas, U. a. horribilis, U. a. sitkensis and U. a. stikeenensis are not distinct or cohesive groups, and would
      more accurately be described as ecotypes. For example, brown bears in any particular region of the Alaska coast are more
      closely related to adjacent grizzly bears than to distant populations of brown bears,[44] the morphological distinction
      seemingly driven by brown bears having access to a rich salmon food source, while grizzly bears live at higher
      elevation, or further from the coast, where plant material is the base of the diet. The history of the bears of the
      Alexander Archipelago is unusual in that these island populations carry polar bear DNA, presumably originating from a
      population of polar bears that was left behind at the end of the Pleistocene, but have since been connected with
      adjacent mainland populations through movement of males, to the point where their nuclear genomes are now more than 90%
      of brown bear ancestry.[45]</p>
      <p>Brown bears are apparently divided into five different clades, some of which coexist or co-occur in different
      regions.[3]</p>
      <h3>Hybrids</h3>
      <a href="#" class="see-also">See also: Grizzly‚Äìblack bear hybrid and Grizzly‚Äìpolar bear hybrid</a>

      <p>A grizzly‚Äìpolar bear hybrid (known either as a pizzly bear or a grolar bear) is a rare ursid hybrid resulting from a
      crossbreeding of a brown bear and a polar bear. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the
      occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the DNA of a strange-looking bear that had been shot in the
      Canadian Arctic, and seven more hybrids have since been confirmed in the same region, all descended from a single female
      polar bear.[46] Previously, the hybrid had been produced in zoos and was considered a "cryptid" (a hypothesized animal
      for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild).</p>

      <p>Analyses of the genomes of bears have shown that introgression between species was widespread during the evolution of
      the genus Ursus,[47][48][49] including the introgression of polar bear DNA introduced to brown bears during the
      Pleistocene.</p>

      <p>A bear shot in autumn 1986 in Michigan, US, was thought by some to be a grizzly/American black bear hybrid, due to its
      unusually large size and its proportionately larger braincase and skull. DNA testing was unable to determine whether it
      was a large American black bear or a grizzly bear.[50]</p>
